A token that tokenizes the tokenization of nothing in particular. But here's the thing about absurdity—it has a way of becoming accidentally profound.\n\nOur first job: to be the friend to all fair memes on SUI and beyond. To accelerate the weird, the wonderful, and the utterly pointless. Our second job: to empower the artists, the weirdos, the filmmakers—the ones with no voice—to say and do great, absurd things. We make no promises. It would be absurd to.\n\nFor now, just enjoy the ride. It's all ridiculous anyway."
